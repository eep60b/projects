The light clay soil is not difficult to work with. It the ground hasn't been used to cultivated for a long time. The best thing to start is to do a double digging (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_digging). 

1. The double digging will result excessive soil. If you don't want to raise the bed, remove the some from the under-layer. Don't remove soil from top-layer.
2. Light clay soil can be treated by adding sharp sand, although you will still need a lot to convert it into loam.
