The light clay soil contains between 40% and 60% clay powers. it is suitable for most plants after improvement.
The light clay soil is not difficult to work with. For a new garden, the first thing to do is a double digging (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_digging). And this process should be repeated after 3 - 5 year.s

1. Dig off the top layer (1 foot/30cm) to form a shallow trench. put the soil into a wheelbarrow to move them somewhere which are separated with the rest of soil. 
2. Dig the under-layer loose with a fork. 
3. Dig the second trench and backfilling the first trench. Repeat this process until the whole bed has been treated.
4. Fill the last trench with the soil left over from the first trench.
5. During the process, remove the large stones and add organic matter to the top layer soil. Other materials such as gypsum or sharp sands can also be added to improve the soil. 
6. The double digging will result excessive soil. If you want to keep the ground level, remove about half of the soil from the under-layer. Don't remove soil from top-layer.
7. If the garden is small, light clay soil can be converted into loam soil by adding sharp sand. For large garden, this is not practical since too much sand needed.
