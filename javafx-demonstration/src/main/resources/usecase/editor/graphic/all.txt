    E4.1 Ground (AreaRoot)
        E4.1.1 There is only one ground which will be will be 10000 cm X 6000 cm with 1000 pixel X 600 pixel as default.
        E4.1.2 The ground colour is always grey.
        E4.1.3 When the enlarge button is hit, it increases the pixels.
        E4.1.4 There is no drag-and-drop functionality to add an area. 
    E4.2 Area        
        E4.2.1 There will be a default garden area when the project starts.
            E4.2.1.1 The default garden area has a title of "My Garden". 
            E4.2.1.2 The default garden area has a size of 10 m X 20 m centred in the ground.
            E4.2.1.3 The default garden area has a rectangle shape.
            E4.2.1.4 The default garden area shape can be changed if it has not contents.
        E4.2.2 The added area will be filled in brown colour (garden, allotment and farm) or white (indoor (house/office), balcony and patio).  
        E4.2.3 After an area added
            4.2.3.1 The default area should appear with its anchors visible.
            4.2.3.2 The anchors disappear when the mouse clicks (single click) somewhere not on the area edges.
            4.2.3.3 The anchors appear when the mouse clicks on the area.
            4.2.3.4 Drag the area to change shape
                4.2.3.4.1 A floating shape with broken line as boarder will be created. This floating shape will be used to calculate intersection with other areas
                          on the ground. If an intersection occurs, the floating shape will be painted red and the area cannot be added. This floating shape
                          will be materialized to the ground instantly.
                4.2.3.4.2 The rectangle: the side can only move left/right or up/down. drag the side to move side. drag a vertex to move to sides.
                4.2.3.4.3 The square: the side can only move left/right or up/down. 
                4.2.3.4.4 The circle: any point is the same.
                4.2.3.4.5 The triangle: The vertices can move to any direction.
                4.2.3.4.6 The polygon: The vertices can move to any direction. Double click the side to add or remove(when the vertex is on the line) more vertices.

        4.2.4 Single click an area will result in the area being selected. After the selection, the anchors should appear.
            4.2.4.1 Right click the selected area will result a menu which contains edit, delete, rename.
        4.2.5 Double click an area will result in an editor dialog which can modify the information of the area.

        4.2.6 Drawing an area 
            4.2.6.1 The first click on the ground will generate a polyline object. It will generate a sticky line with one end move with the mouse.
                    The line will be solidified when the mouse click to the next time. The double click will finished the drawing and a polygon 
                    will be created using the polyline's trace.
                     
    E4.3 Subarea
        E4.3.1 Subarea can ONLY be created by dragging a subarea icon (plant bed/greenhouse etc.) into an area.
        E4.3.2 Before the subarea icon enters an area, it retains its logo and size. After it enters the area (Not ground), 
              a shape will be created on top of the ground.
        E4.3.3 The default size of the shape will be 1/4 of the area if the area is empty. 
              If the area contains other subareas, the default size will be the largest available rectangle (No larger than 1/4 of the area).
        E4.3.4 The shape will be in the red colour if it intercepts with other subarea or the area boarder.
        E4.3.5 The subarea is filled with green colour for plant bed, 3d green colour for raised plant bed, blue for pool, light green for lawn, light green with a house symbol for green house, grey for room and light brawn for container subarea.
        E4.3.6 Drawing a subarea on areas is similar to the drawing an area on the ground.  
        E4.3.7 They will be represented in broken line during the drawing and become visible after the drawing finished. 
               
    E4.4 Plants (Locations and Location)
        E4.4.1 Dragging a plant subgroup icon over an subarea will automatically create a rectangle shape.
        E4.4.2 The rectangle shape will occupies the empty space as much as possible. The anchors will appear to allow it to be reduced or moved.
        E4.4.3 The rectangle will be transparent and cover all the subarea. The rectangle then can be reduced in size.
        E4.4.4 The rectangle can be moved as long as it does not have a part outside the subarea.
        E4.4.5 The plant inside the rectangle will be shown in its original logo.
        E4.4.6 Right click the rectangle will popup a menu contains plant numbers.
        E4.4.7 If the plant numbers menu item is selected, a dialog will appear for the user to enter a number.
        E4.4.8 If the plant number is not specified, each locations will be automatically filled by the default Locations with 10 cm X 10 cm size. Each Location object will contain one plant.
        E4.4.9 If the confirm button (or double click?) is pressed, those plant inside the subarea will be added.  
        E4.4.10 Dragging one plant icon over an occupied subarea will only add one plant at a time.
        E4.4.11 If the plant is added on top of another plant. It is NOT allowed to added.
        E4.4.12 If no space is available, nothing will be added.
        E4.4.13 Enlarge or shrink the whole display area will cause one icon to represent different set of Location objects. 
        E4.4.13 Click a single plant will get the plant Location icon selected.
        E4.4.14 Right click the icon will result a menu which contain "show information" and  "delete".
        E4.4.20 Press inside the subarea then drag will create a rectangle shape with the press point and the current point as its vetice. select those plants covered by the rectangle

        4.1.4 Drawing a area/subarea will add a Polyline object to the design pane. The rest is treated the same as Polygon. The minimum Polyline interval will be set to 5 pixels 
              no matter how much distance it represents. When the cursor is dragging in the screen, the distance between the current position and the last point will be constantly calculated. 
                Once the minimum distance reaches, a new point is added. A broken line will be presented which constantly linked to the first point. Once the cursor is close to the first point,
                the line will change to solid. 
  
        4.5 Locations objects use the same shape of its subarea parent.
        4.6 The Location object does not have a shape. It is represented by a single icon.
    4.5 Text editor
        4.5.1 There will be no text editor for area and plants in the design pane. Any text change will be done in dialogs.
