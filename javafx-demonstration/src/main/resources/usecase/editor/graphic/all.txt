4. Editor
    4.1 Ground (AreaRoot)
        4.1.1 There is only one ground which will be will be 10000 cm X 6000 cm with 1000 pixel X 600 pixel as default.
        4.1.2 The ground colour is always grey.
        4.1.3 When the enlarge button is hit, it increases the pixels.
    4.2 Area        
        4.2.1 The added area will be filled in brown colour (garden, allotment and farm) or white (indoor, balcony and patio).  
        4.2.2 After an area added
            4.2.2.1 The default area should appear with its anchors visible.
            4.2.2.2 The anchors disappear when the mouse clicks (single click) somewhere not on the area edges.
            4.2.2.3 The anchors appear when the mouse clicks on the area.
            4.2.2.4 Drag the area to change shape
                4.2.2.4.1 A floating shape with broken line as boarder will be created. This floating shape will be used to calculate intersection with other areas
                          on the ground. If an intersection occurs, the floating shape will be painted red and the area cannot be added. This floating shape
                          will be materialized to the ground instantly.
                4.2.2.4.2 The rectangle: the side can only move left/right or up/down. drag the side to move side. drag a vertex to move to sides.
                4.2.2.4.3 The square: the side can only move left/right or up/down. 
                4.2.2.4.4 The circle: any point is the same.
                4.2.2.4.5 The triangle: The vertices can move to any direction.
                4.2.2.4.6 The polygon: The vertices can move to any direction. Double click the side to add or remove(when the vertex is on the line) more vertices.

        4.2.3 Double click the area will result in an editor dialog which can modify the information of the area.

        4.2.4 Drawing an area 
            4.2.4.1 The first click on the ground will generate a polyline object. It will generate a sticky line with one end move with the mouse.
                    The line will be solidified when the mouse click to the next time. The double click will finished the drawing and a polygon 
                    will be created using the polyline's trace.
 
                      
    4.3 Subarea
        4.3.1 Subarea can only be created by dragging a subarea icon (plant bed/greenhouse etc.) into an area.
        4.3.2 Before the subarea icon enters an area, it icon remain its logo and size. After it enters the area (Not ground), 
              a shape will be created on top of the ground.
        4.3.3 The default size of the shape will be 1/4 of the area if the area is empty. 
              If the area contains other subareas, the default size will be the largest available rectangle.
        4.3.4 The shape will be in the red colour if it intercepts with other subarea or the area boarder.
        4.3.5 The subarea is filled with green colour (apart from pool in blue colour).
        4.3.6 Drawing a subarea on areas is similar to the drawing an area on the ground.  
               
    4.4 Plant
        4.4.1 Dragging a plant subgroup icon over an subarea will automatically create a rectangle shape if the subarea is empty. 
        4.4.2 The rectangle will be transparent and cover all the subarea. The rectangle then can be reduced in size.
        4.4.3 The plant inside the subarea will be shown in its original colour. The plant outside the subarea will be shown in dark grey colour.
        4.4.4 If the confirm button (or double click?) is pressed, those plant inside the subarea will be added.  
        4.4.5 Dragging one plant icon over an occupied subarea will only add one plant at a time.
        4.4.6 If the plant is added on top of another plant. It is automatically transferred to an available space.
        4.4.7 If no space is available, nothing will be added.
        4.4.8 Click a single plant will get the plant selected. 
        4.4.9 Press inside the subarea then drag will create a rectangle shape with the press point and the current point as its vetice. select those plants covered by the rectangle

        4.1.4 Drawing a area/subarea will add a Polyline object to the design pane. The rest is treated the same as Polygon. The minimum Polyline interval will be set to 5 pixels 
              no matter how much distance it represents. When the cursor is dragging in the screen, the distance between the current position and the last point will be constantly calculated. 
                Once the minimum distance reaches, a new point is added. A broken line will be presented which constantly linked to the first point. Once the cursor is close to the first point,
                the line will change to solid.   
    
    4.5 Text editor
        4.5.1 There will be no text editor for area and plants in the design pane. Any text change will be done in dialogs.
