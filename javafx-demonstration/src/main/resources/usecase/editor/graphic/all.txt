4. Editor
    4.1 Area editor
        4.1.1 Create an area
            4.1.1.1 The create area button should be large in the centre. Once it is clicked, a new area dialog should appear.
            4.1.1.2 The newly created area should be shown fully in the editor.
        4.1.2 Dragging a subarea into an area will create a floating subarea on top of the area. 
              4.1.2.1 The modal floating subarea sits on top a rectangle transparent image which have a default size of 10 m X 10 m or as much as
                      possible if the area is smaller than 10 m X 10 m. 
              4.1.2.2 The float area should be calculated against the underlying area. Any overlapped subarea is not allowed.
                4.1.2.2.1 The calculation of overlapped area:
                    method 1: Make the whole graph as an 100 m X 100 m area with 1000 X 1000 points. when a subarea is added, 
                              delete those points in the subarea. The rest is empty points. pro: simple, few mistakes can be made. con: a lot of points initially.
                    method 2: Make existing subarea points. These in total are occupied points and should be avoid. pro: easy to start, graph not limited. con: can be slow if too many subareas.
                    method 3: Make all polygons to multiple triangles. (Used)
                4.1.2.2.2 Identification of convex polygon
                    1. create lines between one points to other points apart from its neighbours. If there is one line has interception from any polygon side,  
                    


        4.1.3 Dragging a plant icon over an subarea will automatically create a location with rectangle shape. The location will 
              fill the subarea as much as possible. 
              This shaped subarea and its contents should be kept float until the confirm button is clicked.
