/*
Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if this polygon is convex
(Convex polygon definition: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon)
Note:
There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon (Simple polygon definition).
In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.
Example 1:
[[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Answer: True
Explanation: https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/polygon_convex.png?_=6146986
Example 2:
[[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]
Answer: False

/**
 * Approach: Using Cross Product To see if a polygon is convex, calculate the
 * angles at each of the polygonâ€™s corners. If all of the angles have the same
 * sign (either positive or negative depending on the orientation), then the
 * polygon is convex.
 *
 * Rather than actually finding the angles, we can just find the cross product
 * of the segments on either side of the angles. If the segments at point B are
 * AB and BC, then the cross product has value |AB| * |BC| * Sin(theta) where
 * theta is the angle between the two segments. Because the lengths are always
 * positive, the result is positive if the angle is positive and negative if the
 * angle is negative.
 *
 * Note: Dot Product: Often be used to determine two vectors perpendicular to
 * each other or not. And also could be used to calculate the projection on the
 * other vector. Cross Product: Often be used to determine the direction of
 * plane that composed of the two vectors.
 *
 * The Other Applications of Cross Product: Largest Triangle Area:
